Todo today: Make amplifier circuit to drive electromagnet
Finish assembly
Finish calibration and code

Monday: Get electromagnet core
Collect Data

Tuesday:
Write about materials
Include calibration graph
Include testing methodology
Include circuit diagrams (Multiplexer and amplifier)
Photos of test setup

Wednesday:
Have paper finished


Focus of Paper:

Construction of the tracker (How parts were selected and modified)
The design of the code
The design of the circuits
The math to calibrate magnetometers (Maybe?, probably just use library and explain equations)
The math to calculate the position
The math to do fourier analysis (Maybe?, might just use numpy)
Testing methodology and data
Integration into Unity (Also maybe?)
Next steps (Mount tracker onto hand using lighthouse or markers)
