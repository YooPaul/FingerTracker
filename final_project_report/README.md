# Final Project Submission Materials
This repository contains all the materials required to submit your final project. As noted on the course website, each team may submit a single report, either using the LaTeX or HTML options. When submitting your materials to Gradescope, be sure to archive everything into a single ZIP file. **Note that late submissions are not allowed for the final project, so check the deadline on Gradescope and ensure you submit before it!**

## Required Submission Materials
All submission must include:
- Either a LaTeX (PDF) report or a website (HTML) report
- Teaser image (JPG) and/or a video (MP4)
- Final presentation slides (PDF and PPTX)

## Submitting a Teaser Image and/or Video
In addition to your report, we require that each student team submit a representative "teaser" image or video clip summarizing their project. This element should ideally be either a JPG image or an MP4 (H.264) video. All images and videos should be formatted with a 1920x1080 aspect ratio, although they can be higher or lower resolution as long as the aspect ratio is the same. We'll use these representative images to make a visual record of all the final projects on the course website. You may submit both an image and a video and we'll select between the two. Your video can be up to 2 minutes long and may include audio, if you want to use that to summarize the demo or make a short presentation for your project.

## Submitting a LaTeX (PDF) Report
If you are using the LaTeX template to format your report, then please update [final_project_report.pdf](report/final_project_report.pdf). You can delete the [website](website/) subfolder before uploading in order to reduce the file size. We are using a slightly modified form of the ACM SIGGRAPH template. You can edit your submission using your favorite LaTeX editor and/or Overleaf. If you don't want to use LaTeX, then please consult the ACM website for a [Microsoft Word template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). If you have trouble using the provided template, please contact the instructor and TAs before adopting a new template of your own design. **In addition to your PDF, please include all LaTeX (or Word) files required to edit your submission.**

## Submitting a Website (HTML) Report
If you are using the website template, then you can delete the [report](report/) subfolder before uploading in order to reduce the file size. Please use the website template we provided, so that all student projects will have a consistent format. You may make extensions to this template, including adding JavaScript elements, in order to document your work. When in doubt, contact the instructors and TAs for advice. Make sure to include all files required to view your website in your archive.

## Submitting the Presentation Slides
The final presentation slides should be saved in the [slides](slides/) subfolder. Ideally, teams should submit both PDF and PowerPoint (PPTX) files. You may embed videos in the PowerPoint file, or link to them from within the same subfolder as the PPTX file. You are not required to have speaker notes. If you didn't use PowerPoint, then please include the other source files for your presentation. At a minimum, you must update [final_project_slides.pdf](slides/final_project_slides.pdf).
