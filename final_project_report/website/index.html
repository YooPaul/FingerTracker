            <p>
            The purpose of this project is to build a high-accuracy finger tracking for use in VR. We believe good finger tracking is important because it allows players to interact with VR environments without the needing a controller. Although there are many approaches, we chose magnetic tracking in particular because fingers suffer from occulsion, making other approaches such as lighthouse and marker based tracking inadequite. The layout of the magnetometers is based on the Finexus approach designed by Oculus.

You should select representative images and videos for your project, such as a photo of any device you built or a screenshot of the application you developed. Write captions that explain the asset(s) in your teaser. For this example the following caption would be suitable. In CSE 490V, students were provided this kit to build their own head-mounted display, including an LCD, an HDMI driver board, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), lenses, an enclosure, and all cabling. All software was developed through the homework assignments.</p>

            <p>Remember to update the title, subtitle (if needed), author information, and other details. Please don't submit a report with "Final Project Report" as the title! The introduction is essentially an extended abstract. It is typically 3 to 5 paragraphs long and provides a strong motivation (i.e., why you think this is a useful project to undertake). It should also outline the most important related work (i.e., other publications, products, or similar items that you're improving upon or offering alternatives to). The introduction should also outline what novel approach you're taking or a specific hypothesis you have. You should summarize what you found in this project, as well as what it might mean for future work in this topic.</p>
            
            <h6 class="docs-header">Contributions</h6>
            <p>To conclude the introduction, you should provide a concise list of contributions. These should be complete sentences, as shown in the project report examples. Each item should tie to something specific you achieved (e.g., an  idea you introduced, an algorithm you implemented, an analysis you conducted, a conclusion you reached, or a piece of hardware you built). For a final project, something like 2 to 4 major contributions sounds reasonable.</p>

            <p>This section should review related work, including references to publications, products, and other items you're building on and/or competing with. Try to group these into major topics (e.g., different approaches to algorithmic or hardware problems). Talk about each group in a separate subsection. Use a table or figure to help readers understand particularly complex topics or trade-offs. See the example reports for some idea of how to put this section together.</p>

            <h6 class="docs-header">Method</h6>
            <p>This section is the core of your report. It should outline your key contribution. For example, if this is a report about an algorithm, then you'd provide the high-level mathematics here. If it's a piece of hardware, then you might describe the general concept of the system. If this is a complex system, such as an application, then you'd explain the overall approach you're taking here. Generally, you should avoid detailed implementation aspects at this stage. You can save these low-level details for the implementation section. </p>
            
            <p>Your goal here is to get the theory of your approach documented, which is a more fundamental contribution than the specific implementation you made. For example, the mathematics of volume rendering apply to any volume renderer (of a certain algorithmic family). In that case, you'd want to describe the volume rendering math here, but save how you implemented those equations for the next section. You can use equations or pseudocode in this section to outline the concepts more generally. As a result, you wouldn't usually find mentions to specific software libraries or frameworks in this section. However, there are exceptions to this. If you're building a very specific application, then you might not have a general concept to present. In that case, your method and implementation sections will be mixed together. When it doubt, write the report in the way you would have liked to have received when you started. Your goal is to make it easy for the reader to implement the project from scratch. Just assume you were reading this when you started. If it would have made sense to you, then that's a good test that this section is well written.</p>

            <p>Put in all the specific implementation details here, including both hardware and software aspects. Even if you didn't build a piece of hardware, make sure to document what hardware you used, including your headset, computing environment, and major software libraries. If you implemented specific hardware devices, describe how you decided on the design parameters for the hardware. For example, if you built a VR headset, you'd apply the equations you previously introduced in the method section to decide on the values you used in your construction. If you implemented an algorithm, such as volume rendering, then you'd describe the function implementation details here (e.g., GitHub projects you built on, libraries you used, or specific aspects you found challenging and how you resolved them).</p>

            <p>This section should evaluate the benefits and limitations of your approach. Ideally, these should be quantitative details. If you implemented a foveated renderer, then you'd include measurements of frame time and image quality (e.g., PSNR). If you implemented a piece of hardware, then you'd want to show photographs of the results. Make sure to not just record successes here, but to also document limitations and failure cases. Show where your algorithm works and where it needs improvement. If you ran a user study, then you'd tabulate the statistics in this section and try to make some conclusions, based on that data. Ideally, if you had time to implement prior methods, you should include quantitative comparisons to the most promising related work you reviewed.</p>

            <p>This section may end up being combined with the evaluation and future work sections. The goal is to outline key benefits and limitations. Ideally, you'd link this back to the fundamental details of your approach in the method section. But, some of these limitations may result from your implementation itself. Try to make conclusions about your approach and why it might have advantages and disadvantages.</p>

            <p>This is your chance to predict what the community should work on next. If you had a clear failure case, then speculate how you might resolve it. If your algorithm is lacking in performance, talk about what changes might improve it. Even if you have breakthrough results, then you can still comment on what new work your contribution will motivate. If you found a trend in a user study, then you could comment on what design changes developers should make to apply the your conclusions.</p>

            <p>This section is somewhat redundant with the abstract, but is often included in publications. This can be a single paragraph that is focused on emphasizing the take home messages of your work. This is also a good place to frame why your work matters within the AR/VR community and what might happen as a result of it, or if more researchers started working on this topic.</p>

            <p>This section is for thanking key collaborators that didn't do enough to warrant being a co-author of the paper. If someone financially sponsored your work or mentored you, then it's a good idea to recognize that here. If someone provided really helpful feedback or a great insight, then recognizing that contribution can be done here.</p>
